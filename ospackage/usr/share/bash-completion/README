The bash-completion for saptune now will be generated by 'completely' (https://github.com/DannyBen/completely).
Either use the docker container or install the package on ab OS witch has the required Ruby version. 
SLES or OpenLeap is not among them. :-/


1. Maintain 'saptune-completion.yaml' which describes the arguments and options of saptune.

2. Generate a new completion script by running: completely generate saptune-completion.yaml saptune.completion

3. Add the following lines to the generated completion script at the beginning of the function '_saptune_completions()':

    if [[ "${COMP_WORDS[*]}" =~ ^saptune\ --format\ json ]] ; then
       unset COMP_WORDS[1]  # remove '--format'
       unset COMP_WORDS[2]  # remove '--json'
       COMP_WORDS=( ${COMP_WORDS[@]} )
       ((COMP_CWORD-=2))
    if

  THIS CODE MUST BE EXECUTED BEFORE ANY GENERATED CODE IN THIS FUNCTION!
