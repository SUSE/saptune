The bash-completion for saptune now will be generated by 'completely' (https://github.com/DannyBen/completely).

1. Maintain 'saptune-completion.yaml' which describes the arguments and options of saptune.

2. Generate a new completion script by running: completely generate saptune-completion.yaml saptune.completion
