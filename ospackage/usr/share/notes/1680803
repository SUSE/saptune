[block]
## Type:    string
## Default: noop
#
# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may 
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput. 
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more 
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher 
# throughput.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen 
# scheduler.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop

## Type:    integer
## Default: 1024
#
# IO nr_requests
#
# When set, the number of requests for all block devices on the system will 
# be switched to the chosen value
NRREQ=1024

[limits]
## Type:    integer
## Default: 0 (which means calculation: RAM in KB - 10%)
#
# memlock
LIMIT_HARD=0
LIMIT_SOFT=0
LIMIT_ITEM=memlock
LIMIT_DOMAIN=sybase

[vm]
# Disable transparent hugepages (THP, applies to Intel-based systems only)
# changes /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
# 'never' to disable, 'always' to enable

[sysctl]
# maximum number of asynchronous I/Os.
fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576

# Increase system file descriptor limit
fs.file-max >= 6291456

# Increase Linux autotuning TCP buffer limits
# Set max to 16MB (16777216) for 1GE and 32M (33554432) or 54M (56623104) for 10GE
# Don't set tcp_mem itself! Let the kernel scale it based on RAM.

# If the server is a heavily used application server, e.g. a Database, it would
# benefit significantly by using Huge Pages. 
# The default size of Huge Page in SLES is 2 MB, enabling Huge Pages would aid 
# in significant improvements for Memory Intensive Applications/Databases, 
# HPC Machines, this configuration needs to be done if the Applications support
# Huge Pages. If the Applications do not support Huge Pages then configuring 
# Huge Pages would result in wastage of memory as it cannot be used any further
# by the OS. 
vm.nr_hugepages >= 128

# Discourage Linux from swapping idle processes to disk (default = 60)
# value between 20 and 10
vm.swappiness <= 15

[reminder]
# DBMS data storage settings: use ext4 or xfs file system. 
# For best performance, disable the journal via tune2fs ^has_journal.
# For ext4 the recommended mount options are 'noatime,nodiratime', if journaling is disabled or 'noatime,nodiratime,cache=writeback,barrier=0', if journaling is not disabled
# For xfs the recommended mount options are 'noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,logbufs=8'
# network tuning including transmit queue (ifconfig <eth#> txqueuelen <value>). See Best_Practices_SAP_ASE_v1.2b.pdf (appended to the SAP Note) for more information.
