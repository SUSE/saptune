All JSON schema files in ../ are generated by the build.py script in this directory.
It will load all files of the pattern "saptune*.template" of the current directory 
and render them and put them with the suffix '.template.' removed into the parent directory.

Existing files will be overwritten!

As default build.py will refuse to work until the environment variable FORCE is set to 1.
This should be prevent inadvertent changes. Therefore to update the schema files run:

FORCE=1 ./build.py 

Jinja (https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) is used as templating engine.
