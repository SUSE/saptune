DESCRIPTION=SYB: Usage of HugePages on Linux Systems with Sybase ASE
REFERENCES=https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1805750

[limits]
# Allow Sybase ASE owner to make use of available HugePages.
# add the DBMS user with memlock permission
LIMITS="<DBMSuser> hard memlock unlimited, <DBMSuser> soft memlock unlimited"

[sysctl]
# If the server is a heavily used application server, e.g. a Database, it would
# benefit significantly by using Huge Pages. 
# The default size of Huge Page in SLES is 2 MB, enabling Huge Pages would aid 
# in significant improvements for Memory Intensive Applications/Databases, 
# HPC Machines, this configuration needs to be done if the Applications support
# Huge Pages. If the Applications do not support Huge Pages then configuring 
# Huge Pages would result in wastage of memory as it cannot be used any further
# by the OS. 
#
# Set vm.nr_hugepages high enough so that ASE is able to allocate all its
# memory at startup as huge pages. Otherwise ASE will not make use of HugePage
# memory
# If you change ASE configuration dynamically after it has been booted and ASE
# allocates another shared memory segment, ASE will attempt to allocate the new
# segment using huge pages.
# If enough free HugePages are still available the new segment will get created
# using HugePages, if not ASE will silently fall back and create a shared memory
# segment using standard memory pages.
vm.nr_hugepages=""

# Users who wish to use hugetlb memory via shared memory segment should be a
# member of a supplementary group and system admin needs to configure that gid
# into /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group. It is possible for same or different
# applications to use any combination of mmaps and shm* calls, though the mount
# of filesystem will be required for using mmap calls without MAP_HUGETLB.
#
# Add the Sybase groupid, since ASE uses HugePages and shared memory.
vm.hugetlb_shm_group=""
