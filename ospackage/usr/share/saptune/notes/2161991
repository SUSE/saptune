## Type:    string
## Default: noop or none
#
# The default I/O scheduler for single-queued block layer devices offers
# satisfactory performance for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an
# alternative scheduler may potentially yield better latency characteristics
# and throughput.
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to other schedulers it
# may offer more consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and
# potentially higher throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is
# the better choice.
# With the new introduced multi-queue scheduler for block layer devices the
# recommended I/O scheduler is 'none' as an equivalent to 'noop' for
# single-queued block layer devices.
#
# So IO_SCHEDULER can now contain a comma separated list of possible
# schedulers, which are checked from left to right. The first one which is
# available in /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler will be used as new
# scheduler setting for the respective block device.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to one of the
# chosen schedulers.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop, none
