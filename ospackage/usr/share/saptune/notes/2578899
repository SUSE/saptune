[block]
# The default I/O scheduler for single-queued block layer devices offers
# satisfactory performance for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an
# alternative scheduler may potentially yield better latency characteristics
# and throughput.
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to other schedulers it
# may offer more consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and
# potentially higher throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is
# the better choice.
# With the new introduced multi-queue scheduler for block layer devices the
# recommended I/O scheduler is 'none' as an equivalent to 'noop' for
# single-queued block layer devices.
#
# So IO_SCHEDULER can now contain a comma separated list of possible
# schedulers, which are checked from left to right. The first one which is
# available in /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler will be used as new
# scheduler setting for the respective block device.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to one of the
# chosen schedulers.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop, none

[sysctl]
# vm.dirty_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which a process generating disk writes
# will itself start writeback.
# Note: dirty_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_ratio. Only one of them may be
# specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is immediately taken into
# account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the other appears as 0 when
# read.
# Note: the minimum value allowed for dirty_bytes is two pages (in bytes); any
# value lower than this limit will be ignored and the old configuration will be
# retained.
#
# vm.dirty_bytes should be set to 629145600 (see TID_7010287)
#
vm.dirty_bytes=629145600

# vm.dirty_background_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_background_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which the background kernel
# flusher threads will start writeback.
# Note: dirty_background_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_background_ratio.
# Only one of them may be specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is
# immediately taken into account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the
# other appears as 0 when read.

# vm.dirty_background_bytes should be set to 314572800 (see TID_7010287)
