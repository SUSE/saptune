## Type:    string
## Default: noop, none
#
# The default I/O scheduler for single-queued block layer devices offers
# satisfactory performance for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an
# alternative scheduler may potentially yield better latency characteristics
# and throughput.
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to other schedulers it
# may offer more consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and
# potentially higher throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is
# the better choice.
# With the new introduced multi-queue scheduler for block layer devices the
# recommended I/O scheduler is 'none' as an equivalent to 'noop' for
# single-queued block layer devices.
#
# So IO_SCHEDULER can now contain a comma separated list of possible
# schedulers, which are checked from left to right. The first one which is
# available in /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler will be used as new
# scheduler setting for the respective block device.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to one of the
# chosen schedulers.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop, none

## Type:    integer
## Default: depends on the used I/O scheduler
#
# IO nr_requests
# Increasing the value will improve the I/O throughput, but will also
# increase the memory usage.
# Decreasing the value will benefit the real-time applications that are
# sensitive to latency, but it also decreases the I/O throughput.
#
# possible maximum value depends on the chosen scheduler
# When set, the number of requests for all block devices on the system will 
# be switched to the chosen value

[reminder]
# DBMS data storage settings: use ext4 or xfs file system. 
# For best performance, disable the journal via tune2fs ^has_journal.
# For ext4 the recommended mount options are 'noatime,nodiratime', if journaling is disabled or 'noatime,nodiratime,cache=writeback,barrier=0', if journaling is not disabled
# For xfs the recommended mount options are 'noatime,nodiratime,logbufs=8'.
