# 1984787 - SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 12: Installation notes
# Description:    You want to use SAP software on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SLES 12) or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 (SLES for SAP 12).
# Version 32 from 26.06.2018 in English

[login]
# /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/sap.conf UserTasksMax setting
# see SAP Note 2205917 and 1984787
# This file configures a parameter of the systemd login manager
# It sets the maximum number of OS tasks each user may run concurrently
# The behaviour of the systemd login manager was changed starting SLES12SP2
# to prevent fork bomb attacks.
# No need to set in SLES12SP1.
#
# Note: A reboot is needed after the first setup or after setting a new value
# to get the change take effect.
# The file will be created during the package installation. The value for
# UserTasksMax will be set to 'infinity'
# A message will indicate if a reboot/restart is necessary.
#
UserTasksMax=infinity

[block]
# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may 
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput. 
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more 
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher 
# throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is the
# better choice.
#   
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen 
# scheduler.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop

[sysctl]
# vm.dirty_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which a process generating disk writes
# will itself start writeback.
# Note: dirty_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_ratio. Only one of them may be
# specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is immediately taken into
# account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the other appears as 0 when
# read.
# Note: when changing the tuned profile or switching off tuned, both values
# will be set back to their previous settings.
# Note: the minimum value allowed for dirty_bytes is two pages (in bytes); any
# value lower than this limit will be ignored and the old configuration will be
# retained.
#
# vm.dirty_bytes should be set to 629145600 (see TID_7010287)
#
vm.dirty_bytes=629145600

# vm.dirty_background_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_background_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which the background kernel
# flusher threads will start writeback.
# Note: dirty_background_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_background_ratio.
# Only one of them may be specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is
# immediately taken into account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the
# other appears as 0 when read.
# Note: when changing the tuned profile or switching off tuned, both values
# will be set back to their previous settings.
