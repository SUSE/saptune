After the blog post about <a href="sapconf 5 - What has changed%3f.html">sapconf 5</a> a few hours ago, I was asked by various people:

<strong>Shall we use 'sapconf 5' instead of 'saptune 2'?</strong>

Before rumors or confusion spread, let me clarify.

In short:
<ul>
 	<li>If you have 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server' only 'sapconf' is available.</li>
 	<li>If you have 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications' you can choose between 'sapconf' and 'saptune', but...</li>
 	<li>...'saptune' is the more advanced tool and should be preferred!</li>
 	<li>If you are using 'sapconf 4', update to 'sapconf 5' soon.</li>
 	<li>If you are using 'saptune', stay with 'saptune'!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

And here a bit more details:
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> sapconf 5</th>
<th> saptune 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Available on SLES?</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Available on SLES for SAP Applications?</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does it implements entire SAP notes?</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Can I configure everything?</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Do I have a verify option?</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does it rely on tuned?</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="font-size: 80%"><em><sup>1</sup> Only for starting the 'saptune' binary ('tuned' does no tuning itself). Like with 'sapconf 5' 'tuned' gets removed in one of the next versions.</em></p>
No further major changes to 'sapconf' are planned so far. Removing 'tuned' was on our list for quiet some time.
Of course it will maintained further, but it stays a simple tool, which just does needful things.
<br /><br />
'Saptune' will go on and at the moment we are in development of the next version. Removing 'tuned' is - among other things - on the list.
If you have ideas to better 'saptune', now is a good time to step forward!
<br /><br />
I hope the world of 'sapconf' and 'saptune' looks a bit clearer now!
