A few weeks ago I announced the upcoming release of saptune 3 <a href="saptune 3.1 on the Horizon.html">saptune 3.1 on the Horizon</a> and what it will bring.
<br/><br/>
Now the time is up!
<br/><br/>
Around the end of last week saptune 3.0.0 turned up (almost) in the official repositories for:
<ul>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP3</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP4</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP5</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 (in a few days)</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP1</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP2</li>
 	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP3</li>
</ul>
The SLES for SAP Applications Guide (<a href="https://documentation.suse.com/">https://documentation.suse.com/</a>) as well as SAP Note 1275776 have been updated.
As always the man pages shipped with the package are the most detailed source of information.
<br/><br/>
For those who love to lean back and watch some videos to see how things work, I plan to start with a technical saptune series on the YouTube SUSE Products channel very soon. Watch out for a blog post here about it!
