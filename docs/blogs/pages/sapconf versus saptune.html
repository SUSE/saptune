        <h1>sapconf versus saptune</h1>
        <p id="author">August 1, 2018 | By: SÃ¶ren Schmidt</p>
        With the release of the sapconf blog series (<a href="A new sapconf is available.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new sapconf is available</a> a lot of people approached me with questions about how both tools relate to each other. So I thought it would be a good idea to publish a small post about it.
        <h2>What is the purpose of both tools?</h2>
        Sapconf is a simple tool to make only the most important changes on a SLES installation to run SAP applications. It neither distinguishes between SAP applications nor implements entire SAP notes.
        It removes the big rocks. No more, no less.

        Saptune is a more elaborate tool. It can apply entire SAP notes (as far as it possible) and offers prepared combinations (solutions) of notes.
        It is shipped with a commandline tool to easily apply SAP notes or solutions as well as simulate and verify chanages made to the system.
        <h2>Can I use both tools?</h2>
        No. <br>
        Sapconf is part of SLES, so only sapconf can be used. 
        By contrast "SLES for SAP Applications" provides a choice between sapconf and saptune. However, although both tools could be installed together, only one can be used at a time since both use tuned.
        <h2>Is sapconf deprecated?</h2>
        No.<br>
        The warning shown in the logs even by recent versions is a bug and will be fixed in one of next versions.
        <h2>What are the future plans?</h2>
        After reworking sapconf, we now do the same with saptune. We expect to have the new version ready later this year, but I cannot promise anything.
